              <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              These are basically the same thing. Both are about using focussed attention to gain an awareness for your internal thoughts and emotions. And both are skills that can be learned. 
              Also known as <em><strong>Emotional Awareness</strong></em>, this process is about recognising your emotions and their effects. This awareness faciliates self-knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further to this, it is important to develop the skills for <em><strong>Accurate Self Assessment</strong></em>, which is about knowing your strengths and weaknesses. This facilitates self honesty.
            </p>
            <p>
              With awareness and self assessment combined, comes <em><strong>Self Confidence</strong></em>, where you have a strong sense of your strengths and limits. Developing emotional awareness and being able to accurately assess yourself creates the right conditions for self confidence.
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>Body Scan and Journalling</h3>
              <p><em>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</em></p>
            </header>
            <p>
              I tried the Journaling practice and found it to be really interesting. Having the structure and prompts helped to get the activity flowing.
            </p>
            <p>
              When reading back over my journal, I saw that a lot of the positive notes were about family, relationships and my children in particular. It was unexpected just how much of the notes centred around the kids, but I liked that this is where my thoughts often went. And it makes sense, they are pretty awesome.
            </p>
            <p>
              The negative notes confirmed things that I'm quite aware of, so no real surprises there. 
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This section is really aligned to what I've been trying to practice for a little while. That subtle shift of a change in perspective from "I am..." to "I feel..." or "I notice I am having the thought..." is quite powerful in changing your experience in a given moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really liked the metaphor used:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              <em>"Thoughts and emotions are like clouds - some beautiful, some dark - while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a great image to keep in mind, particularly in moments where it may feel like a feeling or thought is set in stone.
