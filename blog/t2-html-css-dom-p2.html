        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p>
           This is the method of breaking up your webpage into a series of rows and columns - resulting in a grid-like structure. It enables the use of frameworks that work on this basis, utilising divisions and classes to create the structure and this can be applied in all sorts of creative ways.
        </p>  
        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>
            Remember when you first started to use tablet or mobile devices, but web pages were still designed for your standard PC or laptop screen? Everything was so small and impossible to navigate. Then sites started to develop mobile-friendly ones and we all went "Phew! This is so much better and now I can comfortably spend hours looking at my favourite sites, on my phone, in peace."
        </p>  
        <p>
            Or perhaps even recently you've been looking at a site, shrunk down your browser and lost half the content off to the side (or maybe it all just smushed into a lump in the middle of the page, like my blog as at 19/01/2018...). This is because the content has kept to their static size/position in the page. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, responsive design is all making sites pleasing to the eye and easy to use no matter if you're viewing them full screen on a PC, looking down at your phone or perhaps you have multiple tabs open on your laptop and your screen size is somewhere in between. Having a responsive design means that images, text, sections all adjust automatically to give the best experience.
        </p>
        <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
        <p>
           This is a way of structuring your code that provides meaning both to the developer and the browser interpreting the code. This is done by breaking the structure down into different elements and assigning attributes to these.
        </p>  
        <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
        <p>
            <u>Structure</u> - Get in the habit of building the structure first, worry about the content later.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Frameworks</u> - There are a number of different open-source frameworks available for use and you can use these alongside the unique/bespoke CSS you may also want to use. It doesn't have to be just one or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Responsive Design</u> - This can be used in really creative ways to give a very cool experience for the user. Looking forward to playing with this further.
