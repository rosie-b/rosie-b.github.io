        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is something that we can all work on, at any point in our lives. Ideally, this is something to be at least aware of. Like any skill, it requires focussed practice and we all have areas of strength or for improvement. Breaking it down into the five domains is quite a useful check-in tool and makes sure the focus is both on the intrapersonal and interpersonal points of view.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Self-Awareness</li>
          <li>Self-regulation</li>
          <li>Motivation</li>
          <li>Empathy</li>
          <li>Social skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ultimately, continuously building on this intelligence has a positive impact on your own experience of life and also those around you. It helps you to be a better collaborator, leader, partner - the list goes on.

        <h3> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
          I've always found meditation to be quite challenging, so the idea of 2 minutes of mindfulness meditation was quite daunting. However, after reading the chapter and considering it to be about training the mind to keep coming back into focussed attention (and it's OK not to be perfect at this), I started to think of it more like going to the gym.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to my daily mindfulness meditations now and put it in the same bucket as my gym goals. I'm hopeful that over time, it will get easier to pull myself back to attention and that this will become less of a conscious effort.
