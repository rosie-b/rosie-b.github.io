              <h3>Triggers</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              I hadn't really considered triggers when programming up until this point and hadn't considered that I'd experienced particular or dispropportionate emotional responses. However, when reading about the various forms of what being triggered looks like, I think I've actually been experiencing it fairly frequently in my body.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I have been working on a problem for some time and don't feel like I'm getting any closer to a solution, I notice that I start to feel quite nauseous (like motion sickness) and have difficulty focusing. Logically and based on previous experience, I know that with time and practice, I will solve the problems. So being triggered isn't particularly distressing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps I need to take note of these times and put into practice some techniques to help me identify them for what they are and shift through them with more purpose.

              <h3>Siberian North Railroad exercise</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This exercise was interesting, as I found it quite challenging to come up with a specific memory of an unhappy event, experience of frustration, anger or hurt. However, when relaxing my mind and focussing on my breathing I experienced quite a strong physical response to whatever was going on in my subconsious.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that this tells me that there is a lot ticking over in my subconsious, sitting there in the background and potentially triggering me without my being totally aware. I need to spend more time montioring my physical reactions and identifying what these are related to, so that I can move through them more effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general terms, the practice of Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond is a familiar approach in the context of parenting. I've noticed that the times where I take a deep breath, see what my kids are trying to achieve, put myself in their shoes and respond in calm kindness, the outcome is always so much better than the alternative.
