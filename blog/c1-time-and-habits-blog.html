    <h1>Time & Habits</h1>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>
        I have been trying the "4 questions to ask yourself each day", from earlier resources/articles on the concept. This is to help me build awareness of what I'm trying to achieve, what I think I'm able to achieve today and then what I'm actually able to achieve in the time I have available. The questions are:
        <ul>Start of day
            <li>What are my goals today?</li>
            <li>What are my challenges today?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>End of day
            <li>Have I reached my goals today?</li>
            <li>What have I learned today?</li>
        </ul> 
        I have also been paying closer attention to myself and when my mind wonders, bringing it back on task. If that's not working, I'll stop and get a cuppa.
    </p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
        A lot of the materials were familiar, as I've been starting to explore this area in recent months. I find the fixed vs growth mindset particularly interesting. Since reading the book, it's been really fascinating exploring where my headspace is at in a current moment/on a current task (particularly if I'm feeling challenged or stressed out). And in reflecting on past situations, analysing where I may have been at and what impact this had.
    </p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
        Setting daily tasks and reflecting on these has been great for keeping me on task, having tangible achievements each day and helping me improve on my estimation skills.
    </p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>
        I will be experimenting with the Pomodoro technique. I'll also be delving more into meditation techniques, as this is something I've found challenging and want to improve on.
