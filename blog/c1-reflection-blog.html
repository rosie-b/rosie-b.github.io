    <h1>Reflection Blog</h1>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>
        This experience is intensive, it's about laying the foundations for a solid understanding of web development and also helping us to better understand ourselves, others and learn how we can bring out the best in each other. The opportunity will be what we make of it. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
        There is a consistent message that the technical skills are important, but the cultural side is REALLY important. The boot camp is really intensive, which provides such a great opportunity to immerse ourselves - to totally let go of the habits we may have built up and ideas we may have about ourselves and our abilities. Be vulnerable, ask lots of questions, utilise this time to really explore and draw from other people's skills and experience. And share - everyone has a unique set of skills and experiences, with value to offer.

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
        I can be a little bit shy when starting out, but once comfortable I really look forward to working more with everyone and learning from everyone's experiences. The culture of continuously learning, the IKE values and personal accountability for getting the most out of the boot camp are right up my alley.

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>
        This has reinforced my existing expectations of EDA.

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm really excited about this learning environment and it's one that I've seen people trying to create in the workplace, so I look forward to taking habits away with me when I get back into the workforce. With excitement comes nerves, which is mostly centred around the 'unknown'. But also, making sure I still have time for my family (timeboxing - my new favourite word).
