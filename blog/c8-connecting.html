              <h3>Trust and Sincerity</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Establishing trust and sincerity is really important to me in both personal and working relationships, so the techniques discussed in this chapter are familar ground. 
            </p>

              <h3>Empathetic Listening</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This went well and I did this informally with a friend. Due to the nature of the situation and wider relationship dynamics, it was really important let her lead the conversation, acknowledging her pain and perspective as totally valid, while also resisting any urge to offer solutions.  
            </p>
            <header>
              <h3>Loving Kindness Meditation</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This was mixed. On my first attempt, the exercise did not feel completely authentic as I kept thinking "Well, of course I want someone I care about to be happy". 
            </p>
            <p>
              So I instead reflected on someone that I had previously had a very challenging relationship with and how different this relationship is now in present day. I then redid the meditation with this "past" person/dynamic in mind. An interesting exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              This feels like quite a handy mini-meditation to do in the those challenging moments, with particularly challenging people.

              <em>Situation:</em><br>(In my past life as a Release Manager in a development team)<br>We were in the final stages of testing for an upcoming release, where we were incorporating mandatory certificate updates. At the last minute there was confusion about the correct certificates being ordered and roles/responsibilities for testing/release night, as well as availability of the support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>My team was completely 100% reasonable and correct:</em><br>This cyclical support activity should have been addressed many months ago, when it was first recognised as an upcoming task. We were happy to incorporate into our BAU release and assist where needed, but ultimately, the support team should have been organising the certficiates and testing of these.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The other team was completely 100% reasonable and correct:</em><br>The support team was severely under-resourced and those with the necessary knowledge on how the certificate update process worked were no longer in the team. Our system was also not the only one needing updating, so this small team were working around the clock and every weekend to get every other system updated at the same time. It was totally reasonable to expect the development teams to go beyond their normal activity to get this sorted, to ensure their applications continued to function.
