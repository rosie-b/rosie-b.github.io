              <h3>Compassionate Leadership</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              I have been fortunate to have experienced compassionate leadership from both direct managers and non-formal mentors or senior members of my teams over the years. In particular, I've felt this when juggling family and work committments. This genuine compassion, flexibility and interest meant that I was also more invested and productive. 
            </p>
            <p>
              On the flip side to this, I have also experienced not so compassionate leadership or where the compassion / interest has not felt authentic. This impact can be felt even when the leadership is quite removed (i.e. senior leadership). It has resulted in low team morale, average productivity and not feeling like my input adds any real value.

              <h3>Multiplying Goodness Meditation Exercise</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This meditation did't leave me with any particular feeling (i.e. extra positivity or happy glow). By default, I like to see the best in people and their motivations, so can see the benefit of making a habit of this and turning it into more of a conscious thought re: both seeing and giving goodness.

              <h3>Tonglen Meditation Exercise</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Breathing in the challenge / pain was easy, but breathing it out and away I found quite difficult. I've been practicing a similar exercise for a little while (only when breathing out, focus on letting it go). I'll keep practicing this one and instead try to transform it into a positive intention when breathing out.

              <h3>SCARF Model</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              This model is around the drivers behind social behaviour. In terms of Phase 0 and bootcamp: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Status - </strong>Phase 0 has been a fairly solo experience for day to day learning and I've definitely been competing with myself. When visiting Slack, check ins and other blogs, I've really enjoyed the various stages everyone is at and strengths we all have. Moving into Bootcamp, I'll be looking to keep this mindset (re: competing with myself) and see how we can help eachother improve.</li>
              <li><strong>Certainty - </strong>This one has been a hum in the back of my mind so far and this will continue on in bootcamp. I will be trying to focus on the present task at hand and not get too caught up in worrying about the unknown.</li>
              <li><strong>Autonomy - </strong>This has been present in those times where I feel like I'm never going to get to the solution / finish a build. It helps knowing that there is always an answer, but it will be important to be mindful of this in bootcamp. I think I can spend longer than necessary in this stress of feeling like the solution is out my control.</li>
              <li><strong>Relatedness - </strong>So far in my EDA experience, everyone has been "friend" by default, so I feel like this has helped and will continue to help during bootcamp.</li>
              <li><strong>Fairness - </strong>While this one is important to me, it hasn't really come up in Phase 0 and I anticipate a similar experience in bootcamp. Everyone seems to be on the same page re: motivation, helping others and really wanting to be a part of this.</li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Difficult Conversations</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              For most of my life, I have been quite conflict adverse. However, in recent years I have seen the benefit of having difficult conversations, given the right situation and if this conversation is going to add value. This has largely been down to my kids, who have made me feel less concerned about always keeping the peace and being comfortable with someone disagreeing with me. Sometimes loudly and very close to my face. And in a busy pubic space. Thanks kids.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preparing and running through the conversation from various angles in my mind helps. And I would generally only have the conversation if there is a purpose or solution. I find that when this is missing, the conversation just goes around and around, leaving the participants feeling quite grim afterwards.
