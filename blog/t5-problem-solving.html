              <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Getting blocked is a fairly regular occurance, sometimes it's minor and takes a few minutes to problem solve. Other times, it takes multiple attempts and a few coffees.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a minor block with the final step of the "dom-applying-classes" exercise. All was working fine until I put in the last function. To solve this, I commented out this latest piece of code and brought it back bit by bit. No good. So, I checked to make sure that the names I was using were relevant. Still no good. It wasn't until I wiped my last piece of code and typed it out again from scratch that I saw I'd left out an 's', which made all the difference. Finding the solution didn't take too long, as I was confident that I was on the right track.

              <h3>Elegant Solution</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              To be honest, I can't say I've got a firm enough grip on JavaScript yet to have made any elegant solutions! But something I did with the eloquent.js activities is that once I'd gone as far as I could in coming up with a solution (which included techniques of trying something, psuedocode, googling, reading previous chapters of the book), I then compared the code I'd written with the solution. I then re-wrote my code in a format that felt natural to me and added detailed comments of each line of code, describing what the code did. This helped me to better understand what each item was doing.

              <h3>Reflection</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              I'm fairly confident in utilising psuedocode, try something, rubber ducky method and googling. I need to get better at reaching out to peers and coaches, especially as everyone is so friendly and helpful. And I need to get more confidence/practice with reading error messages and using the console.log.
